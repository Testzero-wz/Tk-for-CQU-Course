</br> 
+ If you got an error when you Login, make sure your what you input are both correct and try again.
+ If the program no responese after you click **Login Button**, perhaps  our CQU teaching administration system were busy, plz wait a moment.
## Second 
If your ID & password are correct, the seceond window will show up
(Like this)
</br>

</br>  
Left box is about lesson list while right side box will contain the course detailed information you choose on the left side.
</br>  

When you double click on the item which is no about course(Like the first, second item), it will be a notice on the right window

</br>


At most,   only three courses can be selected and you can click the **Clear Button** remove all you selected.
The refresh button offer a function which you can refresh  the course info by hand, but  I **highly recommend**  not using this feature when it is not necessary, it may cause a servere network congestion which is not good for you and other students .
</br>


Finally, click the **Submit Button** and the courses you selected will send to the server,  then it will automatically refresh once , you needn't refresh again .

## Tips
**There are no any alert message or notice  when your  requests are successfully handled by servers or not .**

**The only thing you can do is  wait for the message box on the left to update :)**

**Ahahahahah**
